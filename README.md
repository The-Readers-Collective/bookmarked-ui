## Overview
Bookmarked is a digital book-swapping platform, allowing users to add and lend out their personal library, browse the other books currently in circulation, and bookmark titles of interest. It was designed and built by a team of both front and back-end students from the Turing School of Software and Design using React, Ruby on Rails, and GraphQL.

## Project Context
As Mod 4 students in the Front-End program at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://frontend.turing.edu/), Bookmarked is our final Capstone Project-- meaning we have been studying software development for approximately six months at the time of its completion.

Learning Goals for this project included:      
✔️ Gain competency with GraphQL <br> 
✔️ Use an agile process to turn well defined requirements into deployed and production ready software <br>
✔️ Practice an advanced, professional git workflow including a Pull Request Review <br>
✔️ Focus on communication and collaboration between FE and BE teams to design and build a working application <br>
✔️ Build an application that execute in development, cypress testing, CI, and production environments
